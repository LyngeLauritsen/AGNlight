The Explanatory Supplement for the All-Sky Release is currently

information.

</a><a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/IM/">

</a></p></li><li><a name="upperlim">"I would like to measure upper magnitude limits in 
J, H, and K<sub>s</sub> at a particular position, using the online Atlas 
Images.  Is this possible, and what are the limitations?"
<p>
First a caveat:  the 2MASS Atlas Images that are currently available
from the IRSA web services (irsa.ipac.caltech.edu) are lossy-compressed
"Quicklook" versions of the images.  The compression algorithm sacrifices 
information particularly in the low order bits of the images,
so background levels are compromised.  For this reason, we do not
recommend attempting to measure brightness upper limits from
the Quicklook images.  
</p><p>
An alternative to estimating upper limits for 
non-detected sources would be to examine the properties of the 2MASS Point 
Source Catalog (PSC) entries in the vicinity of the position of interest. 
You can do this with a simple position-radius search using
the IRSA GATOR tool.  Find sources in the vicinity of your positions that
are detected in only 1 or 2 of the 3 2MASS bands (look at
the "<i>rd_flg</i>" values in the PSC entries: non-detected bands
are indicated with <i>rd_flg</i>="0" in the appropriate
digit).  For the bands with non-detections, the quoted magnitudes
are 97% confidence upper brightness limits that were determined
by placing an aperture down on the non-compressed Atlas Image 
at the source position and measuring the signal and noise.
You should be able to measure a characteristic
upper limit for each band from the sources around your position.
You can then quote these as approximate upper limits for your 
sources.  
</p></a><p><a name="upperlim">
</a><a name="conversion">
</a></p></li><li><a name="conversion">
"What are the pixel units on the Atlas Images,
and how do I convert these units into magnitudes?"
<p>
The pixel values for the Atlas Images are in data-number units ("DN").
They are not normalized by area - which is approximately 
1 arcsec<sup>2</sup>/pix.
To convert a measurement on the Atlas Images to a calibrated mag, you need 
the zero point magnitude given in the image header. Look for the keyword 
"MAGZP".  It is then straightforward to compute the calibrated mag:
</p><p>
<i>mag = MAGZP - 2.5 log<sub>10</sub> (<i>S</i>)</i>

</p><p>
where the <i>S</i> is the integrated, background-subtracted flux in "DN"
measured in some region.  You do not need to divide by exposure
time because that has been taken into account in the calculation
of the zero point values.
</p><p>
If you are referring to the extended source "postage stamp"
images, then you need to look for the header keywords:
"JMAGZP", "HMAGZP" and "KMAGZP", for the J, H and K<sub>s</sub> bands
respectively.

</p></a><p><a name="conversion">Because the pixels in the Atlas Images were generated by combining and
upsampling pixels in the individual 2MASS exposures, adjacent Atlas Image
pixels are correlated.  This correlation must be taken into account
when estimating photometric uncertainties in measurements
on the Atlas Images.  Please see section </a><a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/sec6_8a.html">VI.8.a</a> of the
Explanatory Supplement for guidelines on how to do this.

</p><p>
<b>A word of warning</b>:  You should <b>not</b> use the compressed, 
QuickLook images, available from the Quicklook Image Tool on IRSA.
These have been lossy compressed, so for point sources, the accuracy
of the photometry is, at best, ~10%.  You should not attempt isophotal
photometry on extended sources at all for these Images.  
</p><p>
<a name="truncated">
</a></p></li><li><a name="truncated">"I find it sometimes difficult to
match the result of a coordinate query of the Extended Source Catalog (XSC), 
because the field <i>id_cat</i> is only <b>9 characters long</b>, and thus,

<p>
(The following information applied to the Second Incremental Data Release
Catalogs.  It may be now out-of-date for the All-Sky Data Release.)
</p></a><p><a name="truncated">
The </a><a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/">NED</a> identifiers extracted 
for 2MASS extended sources are unfortunately truncated at 9 characters during 
pipeline processing, so the full names are not available.  We would have to 
run a query against NED to recover the identifiers, which is something
that you can actually do yourself.  Fortunately, NED is doing
the matching for us all.
</p><p>
If you go to the "By Parameters" selection under "OBJECTS"
on the main <a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/">NED</a> web site,
you will see that it is now possible to select NED holdings 
according to source name prefix.  Thus, you can select the 2MASS prefix, 
and Submit the Query, to obtain listing for the 2MASS XSC objects in NED.

Yes.  The "jdate" column in the All-Sky Release PSC and XSC gives the Julian

If you are using the the GATOR Catalog query engine at
</a><a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/">IRSA</a>,
"jdate" is part of the "standard" format of available Point Source Catalog
columns that can be selected

the morning that an observation is completed), can be selected as part of
the "long form" format for available columns.

<p>
The wording in the Explanatory Supplement and in the Extended Source Catalog
column descriptions for this parameter is not quite accurate.
The half-light surface brightness refers to the mean flux <i>within</i> the 
half-light (effective) radius.  
In other words, it is the mean surface brightness, which
is also known as the effective surface brightness.
